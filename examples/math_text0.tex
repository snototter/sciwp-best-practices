Throughout all experiments we set $\lambda = 1\mathrm{e}{-5}$. 

The mass-energy equivalence states that
\begin{equation}
  E = m c^2,  \label{eq:equivalence}
\end{equation}
where $m$ denotes an object's mass and $c$ is the speed of light.

Recall Eq.~\eqref{eq:equivalence} on the mass-energy equivalence \dots
