### What is this?
A collection of recommendations/best practices/dos and don'ts for scientific writers &amp; presenters (especially for Computer Science students) based on our experience, us checking the books on these topics, as well as us correcting the recurring mistakes from our students (over and over and over again).

### Why should I care?
You won't be successful unless you learn how to communicate your research/ideas/findings to your audience.
Scientific writing is an actual craft and many students only realise this upon the first rejections (e.g. due to clarity issues).
This document helps you avoid the most common pitfalls and mistakes beginners stumble upon.

### Why did you do this?
Because telling the exact same thing to the 100th student in a row is not even remotely as fun as it sounds.
In fact, 9 out of 10 students succumb to multiple(!) of the common pitfalls we include in our guide.
Save yourself (and your supervisor) the unnecessary effort to re-iterate over such easy-to-avoid mistakes - especially when all it takes is about 20 minutes of your time skimming through this guide.
